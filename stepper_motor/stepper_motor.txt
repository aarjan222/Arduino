A4988
16 pin headers
power supply = 3 to 5.5v
1A, 1B, 2A, 2B  are connected with a bipolar stepper motor 4 wires are internally connected with two colis. 
1A and 1B to one coil of the stepper motor 
1A and 1B to other coil of the stepper motor

VMOT and GND to power from 8 to 35 volts
if not using CNC shield then use decoupling capacitor of at least 47uF
from protecting the drivers from voltage spikes

STEP and DIRECTION pin for controlling the motor movements

dir = for rotation direction of the motor
to the digital pins on our microcontroller

step pin for controlling the microsteps of the motor and each pulse sent to this pin motor moves one step 

sleep pin = to minimize the power consumption
low on this pin puts driver in sleep mode

reset = set the translator to a predefined home state
